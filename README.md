# Vehicle_Detection_using_opencv
Accidents are more common nowadays to reduce them traffic management is one of the solution so this repository contians a stepping stone to vehicle detection. Vehicle detection involves detecting the vehicles which are moving in a certain video so to do this we took help of Python OpenCv library which involves functions which can capture images and load images,videos etc.
Haar cascade classifiers plays an important in detecting the vehicles which are predefined for each vehicles and easily available on github it varies for each vehicle. Haar classifiers detects the features of the vehicles using horizontal and vertical strips. So all you need to do is copy the folders from my github and paste them in your working directory. 
Each folder consists of three files which are 

--> Python fies

--> Cascade files

--> Video for detecting the vehicles

place the python and cascade file which is .xml file and video in the same folder don't misplace the cascade files and python files and videos and run the python code for each vehicle.
